We will create another <vector<vector>> visited to store all the zeroes after chaning them.

we will use two loops to loop and traverse through i first for i<n and if we find 0 we change the whole i column to zero

we will use two loops to loop and traverse through j first for j<m and if we find 0 we change the whole j column to zero

then we use two loops to put all the visited values in matrix
